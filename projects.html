<h4>TITLE: Mission One</h4>
<h4>YEARS: 2017, 2018</h4>
<h4>SOFTWARE: Unity(C#), Gimp, Audacity, Notepad++</h4>
Project started in September 2017 and finished in May 2018. 
My second big project brought to an end. 
I focused mainly on programming and graphics therefore story in game is simplified. 
You play as a Admiral of the spaceship and your mission is to destroy all enemy ships. 
You gain experience and new technologies through the gameplay. 
While you have to destroy hostiles, you must also watch out for their fire and deadly meteors.

<h4>TITLE: Tournament of Magicians</h4>
<h4>YEARS: 2016, 2017</h4>
<h4>SOFTWARE: Unity(C#), Gimp, Audacity, Notepad++</h4>
Huge and ambitious project started in October 2016 and finished a year later. Major improvement over my previous projects. First game written completely in C# instead of UnityScript. Some of the graphics were created by me (including all the characters) and I did the whole programming. 
-Fully working game - 40 different cards and 9 characters.
-Working demo saving and loading system - possibility of watching match again.
-GUI Scalling which allows to play in 4:3 (like 1024x768) or in 16:9 (ex.1920x1080) with some additional visible cards.
-Project had also working multiplayer, which was removed due to causing bugs on other parts of game and is obviously not showed in this version.
Funfact: Most of the game (excluding menu) runs on single C# script which contains almost 3000 lines of code.

<h4>TITLE: unnamed</h4>
<h4>YEARS: 2016</h4>
<h4>SOFTWARE: Unity(JS), Gimp, Blender, Notepad++</h4>
Project created in March 2016 (abandoned in September).
Tribute to old-school RTS games like Warcraft 2.
Milestone for my programming skill - nicely working and optimized pathfinding. 
Abandoned due to many major bugs and lack of skill(mainly in graphics). 
It was probably too ambitious back then.

<h4>TITLE: unnamed</h4>
<h4>YEARS: 2015, 2016</h4>
<h4>SOFTWARE: Unity(JS), Gimp, Audacity, Notepad++</h4>
Project started on 9th September 2015 and continued to February.
My first try with RPG games. 
I wanted to get something similar to games you can make in RPGMaker. 
Fight screen in this game was based on Disciples franchise by Strategy First.
Whole project was made mainly for fun rather than something more serious. 
At least I've improved my skills a bit.
Game had only Polish version.
I made scripts for movement, fighting, picking and equiping stuff. 
Graphics were also mine (well I shouldn't be proud of them, should I?).
