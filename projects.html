<h4>TITLE: Mission One</h4>
<h4>YEARS: 2017, 2018</h4>
<h4>SOFTWARE: Unity(C#), Gimp, Audacity, Notepad++</h4>
<div class="desc">
	Project started in September 2017 and finished in May 2018.  <br/>
My second big project brought to an end.  <br/>
I focused mainly on programming and graphics therefore story in game is simplified.  <br/>
You play as a Admiral of the spaceship and your mission is to destroy all enemy ships.  <br/>
You gain experience and new technologies through the gameplay.  <br/>
While you have to destroy hostiles, you must also watch out for their fire and deadly meteors.  <br/>

<h4>TITLE: Tournament of Magicians</h4>
<h4>YEARS: 2016, 2017</h4>
<h4>SOFTWARE: Unity(C#), Gimp, Audacity, Notepad++</h4>
<div class="desc">
	Huge and ambitious project started in October 2016 and finished a year later. Major improvement over my previous projects. <br/>
My first game written completely in C# instead of UnityScript. Some of the graphics were created by me (including all the portraits) and I did the whole programming. <br/>
-Fully working game - 40 different cards and 9 characters.<br/>
-Working demo saving and loading system - possibility of watching match again.<br/>
-GUI Scalling which allows to play in 4:3 (like 1024x768) or in 16:9 (ex.1920x1080) with some additional visible cards.<br/>
-Project had also working multiplayer, but to be honest it had many bugs.<br/>
Funfact: Most of the game (excluding menu) runs on single C# script which contains almost 3000 lines of code. <br/>

<h4>TITLE: unnamed</h4>
<h4>YEARS: 2016</h4>
<h4>SOFTWARE: Unity(JS), Gimp, Blender, Notepad++</h4>
<div class="desc">
	Project created in March 2016 (abandoned in September). Tribute to old-school RTS games like Warcraft 2. <br/>
Milestone for my programming skill - nicely working and optimized pathfinding.  <br/>
Abandoned due to many major bugs and lack of skill(mainly in graphics). It was probably too ambitious back then. <br/>

<h4>TITLE: unnamed</h4>
<h4>YEARS: 2015, 2016</h4>
<h4>SOFTWARE: Unity(JS), Gimp, Audacity, Notepad++</h4>
<div class="desc">
	Project started on 9th September 2015 and continued to February. My first try with RPG games.  <br/>
I wanted to get something similar to games you can make in RPGMaker.  <br/>
Fight screen in this game was based on Disciples franchise by Strategy First. <br/>
Whole project was made mainly for fun rather than something more serious. At least I've improved my skills a bit. <br/>
I made scripts for movement, fighting, picking and equiping stuff.  <br/>
Graphics were also mine (well I shouldn't be proud of them, should I?). <br/>
